# Language Models and AI Exploration

Welcome to the Language Models and AI Exploration repository! This project is a collection of implementations and integrations of various advanced AI technologies, focusing on language models and embeddings. Here you'll find examples and utilities for working with OpenAI's GPT models, Anthropic's LLm, Hugging Face API, Gemini API, and local embeddings.

## Features:
- **OpenAI GPT Models:** Integration and examples of OpenAI's powerful language models.
- **Anthropic LLm:** Explore LLm models for advanced language understanding tasks.
- **Hugging Face API:** Utilize Hugging Face models for various NLP tasks and embeddings.
- **Gemini API:** Integrate with Gemini API for blockchain-related AI applications.
- **Local Embeddings:** Implement and experiment with custom embeddings for specific use cases.
